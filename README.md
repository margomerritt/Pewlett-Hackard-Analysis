# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform employee research for the company Pewlett Hackard. This analysis revolves around the companies retirement package. This project needs to answer the following two questions: Who will be retiring in the next few years? And how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? The goal of this analysis is to generate a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package.

### Resources

* Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
* Software: PostgreSQL 12, pgaAdmin 4

## Results
This project produced four tables in pgAdmin 4 that were then exported to csv files for further analysis. The four csv files that were produced are: retirement_titles.csv, unique_titles.csv, retiring_titles.csv, and mentorship_eligibilty.csv.
* In retirement_title.csv we pulled data from the Employees table and the Titles table to form a new table with six columns of data. The columns are employee number, first name, last name, job title, from date, and to date. The data was then filtered to retrieve the data of employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. From this table we found out that there are 133,776 employees who fit this criteria.

* In the unique_titles.csv table we pulled data from the retirement_titles.csv table and then filtered the to_date to exclude employees who have already left the company. The unique_titles.csv table has four columns of data. These columns are: the employee number, first name, last name, and job title. This table shows that there are 72,458 employees who meet this criteria.

* In the retiring_titles.csv file we created a table with two columns of data. These two columns are the count of the titles retiring and the title of the job position. From this table we see that there are 7 job titles that are retiring. These seven job titles are: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager.

* The mentorship_eligibility.csv table contains seven columns of data. The columns are: the employee number, first name, last name, birth date, from date, to date, and job title. This data filtered to display data of current employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. From this table we see that there are 1,549 employees who meet this criteria.

## Summary
  In retiring_titles.csv we found the total amount of retiring employees sorted by job title. There are seven different job title categories that have employees that are nearing retirement. By adding up all the retiring employees by job title we find that there is a total of 72,458  employees who are close to retirement across all jobs and departments in the company. Over the course of the silver tsunami there will be 72,458 jobs vacated at Pewlett Hackard. New employees need to be recruited, hired, and trained to take over these 72,458 roles of Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager. 
  
  In mentorship_eligibility.csv we found that there are 1,549 employees who are eligible to be mentors to younger company employees. From retiring_titles.csv we discovered that there are 72,458 jobs that will need to be filled by fresh talent. This gives a ratio of 1 mentor for every 47 mentees. Having only one mentor for every 47 mentees is challenging and pretty much impossible to develop a one-on-one relationship with each mentee. We know that there are 1,549 employees eligible to be a mentor, but that doesnâ€™t mean that all of them have the time to mentor the younger employees. This could give us an even steeper ratio of mentees to mentors. 
  
	One way to get more potential mentors is to expand the age of employees who are eligible to be a mentor. In the Mentorship Eligibility query we filtered the data to find all employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. Filtering the data to get all employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1960 and December 31, 1969 will greatly increase our eligible mentor pool. This will give a ten year birth year range instead of a one year birth year range we had in the original query.
